/**
    For this demo, we're pulling in Bootstrap 4 at the top.
    NOTE: This impacts the full page, and adds weight to your output CSS.

    CDC TemplatePackage has Bootstrap 4 in it, so on cdc.gov pages
    This is redundant.

    If you're building a single page app (the JS renders the full page) and
    need the CDC site header and footer, check this package out.

    npm install @cdcent/templatepackage-react

/**
    It helps to break out your scss files by their function / purpose.
    For simple widgets, this can be a handful of SCSS partials.
    For a more robust single page app, check out this structure:

    https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern

    The folder names aren't important, so long as they make sense
    to your team and signal a common purpose.

// 1. Abstracts
//    Generall anything that doesn't output CSS. Variables, mixins.
@import "./abstracts/variables";
@import "./abstracts/mixins";

// 2. Base
//    Top level page rules. CSS reset, typography / fonts.
// @import "./base/reset"; // for a full page app, you may need a reset CSS
@import "./base/typography";

// 3. Features
//    Start breaking out by feature. Many features, 1 folder.
//    Can by 'components', or what makes sense for your project.

// This helps scope your styles to just your app - important for widgets

    @import "./feature/example";
